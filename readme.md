# HIKos
This is a very simple operation system, that can open, edit and save files, do basic stuff such as cd, dir, shutdown and logoff, run small games and apps (text editor, calculator). See all the commands **[here](https://github.com/HikBit/HIKos/wiki/Commands)**

First time you boot HIKos you will have to create an user. Fill in a weird username and a short password. Next time you boot HIKos you will be asked for username and password. Safety First!! If you forgot your password there is only one option: Create a new user!!

HIKos is written in C# with [Cosmos](https://gocosmos.org). This is the fast way to make an os, if you don't want to create it from scratch.
