# HIKos
This is a very simple operation system, that can open, save and edit files and do basic commands/tasks such as calculator, small games and of course change the textcolor. See all the commands **[here](https://github.com/HikBit/HIKos/wiki/Commands)**

First time you boot HIKos you will have to create an user. Fill in a weird username and a short password. Next time you boot HIKos you will be asked for username and password. Safety First!! If you forgot your password there is only one option: Create a new user!!

HIKos is written in C# using the Cosmos Kernel
